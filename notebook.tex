    In the next hours we are going to train a supervised learning regression
algorithm, the goal of this presentation is to explain what it means and
to get to know some algorithms.

\subsection{Supervised Learning}\label{supervised-learning}

In supervised learning problems, we start with a data set containing
training examples with associated correct labels.

For example, when learning to guess tomorrow electrical consumption, a
supervised learning algorithm takes thousands of days with weather data
along with labels containing the correct consumption for that day.

Expressed more formally, we'd like to build a model that approximates
the relationship \(f\) between the temperature \(X\) and corresponding
electrical consumption \(Y\).

\[ Y = f(X) \]

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/XY.png}
\caption{XY}
\end{figure}

The goal of supervised learning is to predict \(Y\) as accurately as
possible

\subsection{Regression}\label{regression}

Today we will be working on a regression problem.\\
Regression predicts a \textbf{continuous target variable \(Y\)}

Here, target variable means the unknown variable we care about
predicting, and continuous means there aren't gaps (discontinuities) in
the value that \(Y\) can take on.

Your input data \(X\) includes all relevant information about days in
the data set that can be used to predict the consumption, such as
temperature, consumption the day before, consumption the year before.
These attributes are called \textbf{features}, which can be numerical or
categorical (e.g. day of week).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/features.png}
\caption{features}
\end{figure}

You'll want as many training observations as possible relating these
features to the target output \(Y\), so that your model can learn the
relationship \(f\) between \(X\) and \(Y\).

\section{Algorithm 1 : Linear
Regression}\label{algorithm-1-linear-regression}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/linear-regression.png}
\caption{Linear Regression}
\end{figure}

Linear regressions are the most basic algorithms we can find in Machine
Learning.

A linear regression model predicts a target value by simply computing a
weighted sum of features, plus a constant called the bias term (also
called the intercept term):

\[ \hat{y} =\theta_{1}x_{1} + \theta_{0} \]

with 2 features it becomes :

\[ \hat{y} =\theta_{1}x_{1} + \theta_{2}x_{2} + \theta_{0} \]

Graphically, the task is to draw the line that is "best-fitting" or
"closest" to the points \((x_i,y_i)\) where \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) are
observations of the two variables which are expected to depend linearly
on each other.

\section{Polynomial regression}\label{polynomial-regression}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/polynomial-regression.png}
\caption{polynomial regression}
\end{figure}

Maybe the relation between our feature (the temperature) and our target
is not linear ? maybe it is quadratic or even worse : cubic !

If it is the case, a straight line won't work to model our data ...

Hopefully if your data is more complex than a straight line, you can
still use a linear model to fit non-linear data.

A simple way to do this is to add powers of each feature as new
features, then train a linear model on this extended set of features:
this technique is called \textbf{polynomial regression}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/polynomial.png}
\caption{polynomial}
\end{figure}

The algorithm will work exactly the same as a linear regression, using
\(x^2\) as a new feature and trying to find \(\theta_0\), \(\theta_1\)
and \(\theta_2\) so that :

\[ \hat{y} =\theta_{1}x_{1} + \theta_{2}x_{2} + \theta_{0} \]

Nevertheless, we are still making strong asumptions on our model. If you
don't have any idea of the mathematical model (linear, quadratic or
cubic) thant links your features to your target, you might need to
switch to other types of algorithms.

\section{k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)}\label{k-nearest-neighbors-k-nn}

k-nearest neighbors is a good example of a \textbf{non parametric
algorithm}, meaning it makes no previous asumption on the mathematical
model of our \(f\) function.

k-NN seems almost too simple to be a machine learning algorithm. The
idea is to label a test data point x by finding the mean (or mode) of
the k closest data points' labels.

Let's suppose we are now using the day of the week as a new feature in
our consumption prediction

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/knn-example.png}
\caption{KNN}
\end{figure}

You look at the k closest data points and take the average of their
values.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/knn-example2.png}
\caption{KNN}
\end{figure}

The distance used to compute proximity between points is usually the
euclidian distance.

The fact that k-NN doesn't require a pre-de ned parametric function f(X)
relating Y to X makes it well-suited for situations where the
relationship is too complex to be expressed with a simple linear model.

\subsubsection{Side note : hyperparameter
tuning}\label{side-note-hyperparameter-tuning}

We just encountered our first hyperparemeter : the number of neighboors
\textbf{k}.

In machine learning, an hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set
before the learning process begins.

Part of the job of a data scientist is to choose the right
hyperparameters for his model.

Choosing the right parameters has a great impact on \textbf{overfitting}
which is another important concept.

Example :

\begin{itemize}
\item
  if you choose k = total number of points in the training data set\\
  Your KNN model will always make the same prediction : the average
  consumption.\\
  It will be \textbf{biased} and \textbf{inflexible}.
\item
  if you choose k = 1\\
  Your KNN will only look at one similar point to make a prediction, it
  might follow some strange points and outliers and make strange
  guesses.\\
  It would \textbf{overfit} the data, i.e follow it's patterns too
  closely, including the noise.
\end{itemize}

If your model is significantly better on the training data than on the
validation data, which is the hallmark of an overfitting model.

\section{Decision trees}\label{decision-trees}

Decision Trees are versatile Machine Learning algorithms that can per‐
form both classification and regression tasks, and even multioutput
tasks. They are very powerful algorithms, capable of fitting complex
datasets.

Making a good decision tree is like playing a game of ``20 questions''.

This is the decision tree we generated to guess if someone was going to
leave a company during the HR project:

\end{figure}

The first split at the root of a decision tree should be like the first
question you should ask in 20 questions: you want to separate the data
as cleanly as possible, thereby maximizing information gain from that
split.

There are ways to quantify information gain so that you can essentially
evaluate every possible split of the training data and maximize
information gain for every split.

There are a few hyperparameters you can tune with decision trees models,
including \textbf{max\_depth} (max number of questions in the tree).\\
The more questions you ask, the best your results will be, but don't ask
too many questions or you'll overfit your data !

\section{Random forest and ensemble
methods}\label{random-forest-and-ensemble-methods}

A model comprised of many models is called an ensemble model, and this
is usually a winning strategy.

Suppose you ask a complex question to thousands of random people, then
aggregate their answers. In many cases you will find that this
aggregated answer is better than an expert's answer. This is called the
wisdom of the crowd.

Similarly, if you aggregate the predictions of a group of predictors
(such as classifiers or regressors), you will often get better
predictions than with the best individual predictor.

For example, you can train a group of Decision Tree classifiers, each on
a different random subset of the training set. To make predictions, you
just obtain the predictions of all individual trees, then predict the
class that gets the most votes.

Such an ensemble of Decision Trees is called a Random Forest: despite
its simplicity, this is one of the most powerful Machine Learning
algorithms available today.
